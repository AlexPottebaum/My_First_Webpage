        <h1> This is Ace the Bathound</h1>
        <p> Ace the Bathound is a fight-loving, cheese-loving, snuggle-giving hound we got over a year ago.
            He was supposed to be part-german shepard but really he's more likely part dingo or part coyote.
            He makes everyday that much better by being the bestest boy.</p>
